# Lens Subgraph
Fork of https://github.com/rtomas/lens-protocol-subgraph 

Removed followers entity which was causing huge arrays

Subgraph deployment: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/rickyesclapon/lens-subgraph

Repo also include social graph addition, but it's not deployed version to keep it more performant (social graph isn't something I personally need)
